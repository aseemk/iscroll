iScroll v4.0 Beta 3
======================

Please note that this is a *Beta version*. I'm making this public to receive your feedback and bug fixes. If you are looking for a stable version please check [my blog](http://cubiq.org/iscroll).

At the moment the priority is to have the basic scroller as solid as possible, especially on Android. Scrolling seems now extremely smooth on Android (2.1/2.2), please test it on your device and let me know.

## About

The overflow:scroll for mobile webkit. Project started because webkit for iPhone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size (width/height) div. So basically it was impossible to have a fixed header/footer and a scrolling central area. Until now.

## Credits and Special thanks goes to
iScroll is evolving thanks to the help of all those who sent suggestions, bug reports and ideas on [github](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll), my [blog](http://cubiq.org) and [googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/iscroll-js/). This is by no means the work of a sole man.
